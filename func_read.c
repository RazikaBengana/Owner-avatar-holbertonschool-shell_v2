/**
  * func_read - program that reads a line of input from the standard input
  *
  * this function is responsible for reading a line of input from the standard
  * input (usually user input);
  * it uses the `getline` function to dynamically allocate memory for the input
  * line, taking care of resizing the buffer as needed;
  * it trims leading and trailing whitespace from the input line and checks
  * for empty lines or lines containing only a newline character
  *
  * Return: a dynamically allocated string containing the input line,
  *         or NULL if no valid input was provided
