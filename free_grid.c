  * free_grid - program that frees memory allocated for a 2D grid of strings

  * it takes the 'grid' as input and first determines its height by counting
  * the number of rows;
  * then, it iterates through each row and frees the memory for the individual
  * strings within that row;
  * finally, it frees the memory for the grid itself
  *
  * @grid: a pointer to the 2D grid of strings to be freed
  *
  * Return: nothing (void)
